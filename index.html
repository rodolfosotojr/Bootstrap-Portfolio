                My name is Rodolfo Soto Jr. I am from Chicago, Illinois and I am first generation Mexican-American. I
                went to a private school
                my entire life and graduated from high school in 2005. After high school I did attend UIC for one
                semester but I was working
                full time at UPS. I thought I found the place I was going to work for the rest of my life but things
                changed and I changed.
                I decided to stop going to school and focus on my career. I spent six years of my life at UPS before I
                made the decision to
                go back to school in 2010.
            </p>
            <p>I enrolled at Richard J. Daley College in the summer of 2010. Since I decided to focus on school, I quit
                UPS after recently
                getting a promotion. I got a part time job at T-Mobile in retail while I was attending Daley full time.
                I was taking as many
                classes I was allowed to as well as taking summer classes. Needless to say, I graduated from Daley in
                2012 with an
                Associates in Science of Engineering. I used my degree to get my foot in the door in the engineering
                field. Currently, I still
                work for T-Mobile but I have been on the engineering side for over four years now. I am a field
                technician working on the
                T-Mobile's network. I am in charge of deploying new sites, upgrading sites, maintaining on-air sites,
                and in charge of
                managing the HUB small cells project.
            </p>
            <p>I am looking forward to a new chapter in my life with the help of this Coding Bootcamp. T-Mobile is
                currently looking for
                software engineers. I was close to getting an opportunity but was beat out by someone who had more
                experience with coding and
                software development. I am hoping this certifacate and the experience I gain from this program that I
                will be able to achieve
                this new goal. I am very excited for the opportunities this program will open up for me and the
                challenges that come with it.
